👋 Hi, I’m Donald

I’m building a strong foundation in Data Science, Machine Learning, and AI, with a long-term focus on decision-making systems across finance and neuroscience.

This repository documents my learning journey through:

hands-on Python projects

data analysis & modeling

applied machine learning

theory-driven exploration (finance, cognition, intelligence)

-----
🎯 **What I’m Working On**

📊 Data Science Foundations
Python, pandas, NumPy, statistics, data wrangling

💰 Finance & Valuation
Financial statements, DCF logic, risk, markets (theory + modeling)

🧠 Neuroscience-Inspired Thinking
Decision systems, reward learning, memory, perception — studied conceptually and connected to ML

🤖 Machine Learning
Regression, classification, clustering, time series, neural networks
